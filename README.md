#Using Time-Series Databases for Energy Data Infrastructures#
 
 The management of energy market data, such as load, production, forecasts, 
 and prices, is critical for energy market participants, who develop in-house
 energy data infrastructure services to aggregate data from many sources to 
 support their business operations. Energy data management frequently involves 
 time sensitive operations, including rapid data ingestion, real-time querying,
 filling in gaps from missing or delayed data, and updating large volumes of
 timestamped and loosely structured data, all of which demand high processing 
 power. Traditional relational database management systems (RDBMSs) often 
 struggle with these operations, whereas time series databases (TSDBs) appear 
 to be a more efficient solution, providing enhanced scalability, reliability,
 real-time data availability and superior performance. This paper examines 
 the advantages of TSDBs over RDBMS for energy data management, demonstrating 
 that TSDBs can either replace or complement RDBMSs. We present quantitative 
 improvements in digestion, integration, architecture, and performance,
 demonstrating that operations such as importing and querying time-series
 energy data, along with the overall system’s efficiency, can be significantly 
 improved, achieving up to 100 times faster operations compared to relational
 databases, all without requiring extensive modifications to the existing 
 information system’s architecture.
